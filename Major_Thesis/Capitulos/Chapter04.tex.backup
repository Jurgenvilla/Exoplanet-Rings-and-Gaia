\section{Introduction}

In this chapter different properties as the CO-luminosity, molecular mass, dynamical mass among others are presented for ALESS070.1 and ALESS122.1 obtained through a spectral analysis of CO emission. All the values where obtained analysing the CO(4-3) vibrational transition detected in our ALMA-band 4 observations, as explained in \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{Chapter} \ref{ch: Analysis}. We also show the SLED for ALESS122.1 including our new measurement, in order to compare it to standard SMGs found in literature and describe the gas properties. An estimation of the CO excitation ladder parameters or CO luminosity ratios $\mathrm{r_{31}}$ and $\mathrm{r_{41}}$ was computed and compared to reported values in literature. A discussion and future work sections are also included. 

\section{CO luminosity and molecular mass}

As was presented in \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{Chapter} \ref{ch:Theoretical}, \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{sub-section} \ref{sssec: Luminosities} we can obtain the CO-luminosity using \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{Equation} \ref{eq: COlum_3} with every variable in the appropriate units to properly obtain the CO-luminosity in $\mathrm{K~km~s^{-1}~pc^2}$ which are the regular units reported in the literature and help us to compare our values with any other data. The redshift we will use is the one obtained through the Gaussian fitting which corresponds to the CO($4\rightarrow3$) transition, and the observed frequency to the mean frequency. The integrated line intensity $\mathrm{S}_\mathrm{CO}\Delta \mathrm{v}$ were computed using the FWHM of each emission line properly converted to units of $\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ using \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{Equation} \ref{eq: FWHM-RV}. The distance luminosity was obtained for every source applying  \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{Equation} \ref{eq: LumDis} as presented in (\textcolor{webgreen}{Hogg et al}, \citeyear{Hogg99}), 

\begin{equation}
 \mathrm{D_L} = \int_0^\mathrm{z} \frac{\mathrm{c}}{\mathrm{H}_0} \frac{\mathrm{dz'}}{\sqrt{\Omega_\mathrm{m} (1+\mathrm{z})^3 + \Omega_\Lambda}}
 \label{eq: LumDis}
\end{equation}

where the cosmological parameters $\mathrm{H}_0$, $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ and $\Omega_\Lambda$ were chosen for a flat universe cosmology ($\Omega_\mathrm{k} = 0$) as presented in \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{Chapter} \ref{ch:Theoretical}, \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{sub-section} \ref{sssec: Luminosities}. Luminosity distance was obtained using \textit{python} numerical integration to solve \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{Equation} \ref{eq: LumDis} and also double checked with a cosmology calculator available on-line developed by (\textcolor{webgreen}{Wright et al}, \citeyear{Wright06}). Both methods led to the same results. The different parameters used to compute the CO-luminosity are shown in \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{Table} \ref{tab: LumDisProp}.\\

\end{table}

The luminosity showed in \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{Table} \ref{tab: LumDisProp} corresponds to a luminosity inferred through the CO($4\rightarrow3$) transition and we need to link it somehow with the molecular gas mass. However, if we want to use \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{Equation} \ref{eq: MolMass_1} we need to convert this value to an equivalent CO($1\rightarrow0$) which is the actual transition which traces the molecular gas. In order to do this we have to use a correction factor for the CO-ladder. Therefore, \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{Equation} \ref{eq: MolMass_1} can be written in general as (see \textcolor{webgreen}{Decarli et al}, \citeyear{Decarli16}), 

\begin{equation}
 \frac{\mathrm{M(H_2)}}{\mathrm{M}_\odot} = \frac{\alpha_\mathrm{CO}}{\mathrm{r}_\mathrm{J1}} \frac{\mathrm{L'_{CO[J-[J-1]]}}}{\mathrm{K~km~s^{-1}~pc^2}}
 \label{eq: MolMass1}
\end{equation}

in \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{Equation} \ref{eq: MolMass1} the term $\mathrm{L'_{CO[J-[J-1]]}}/\mathrm{r}_\mathrm{J1}$ is called the equivalent CO($1\rightarrow0$) luminosity and it is expressed as $\mathrm{L'_{CO(1-0)}}$. In our case $J = 4$, so the correction factor to transform between luminosities which will be used is $\mathrm{r}_\mathrm{41} = 0.31\pm0.06$ which was computed by (\textcolor{webgreen}{Decarli et al}, \citeyear{Decarli16}) performing an extrapolation of the values for $\mathrm{r}_\mathrm{31}$ and $\mathrm{r}_\mathrm{51}$ measured by (\textcolor{webgreen}{Daddi et al}, \citeyear{Daddi15}). In \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{Table} \ref{tab: LastValues} the molecular mass computed through the CO($1\rightarrow0$) luminosity using \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{Equation} \ref{eq: MolMass1} is presented leaving the $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$ conversion factor as a free parameter which can be freely choose depending on the type of source due to the big discrepancies in literature.

\end{table}

For ALESS122.1 the values found for the molecular mass and the equivalent luminosity are in agreement with those reported by (\textcolor{webgreen}{Huynh et al}, \citeyear{Huynh17}), which corresponds to $(13\pm2)\times10^{10}\mathrm{K~km~s^{-1}~pc^2}$ and $(13\pm2)\times10^{10}\mathrm{M_\odot}$, respectively. However, we must take into account that their work was performed using CO($1\rightarrow0$) transition which is not strongly affected by the conversion factors $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$ e.g is less biased.\\

As was presented in \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{Chapter} \ref{ch:Theoretical} from \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{Equation} \ref{eq: MolMass} and \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{Equation} \ref{eq: MolMass_3}, we can obtain the dynamical mass once the molecular gas mass and line luminosity are measured as presented by (\textcolor{webgreen}{Solomon \& Vanden Bout}, \citeyear{Solomon05}) or through the virial estimator as presented by (\textcolor{webgreen}{Taconni et al}, \citeyear{Tacconi08}). The last one is widely used in recent works. However, in the first case the final mass will depend on the CO-to-$\mathrm{H_2}$ conversion factor, while for the other one will depend on the half-light radius. We did not measured any of these values so our results will depend on them. The one-dimensional velocity dispersion is shown in \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{Table} \ref{tab: FitParam_1} and the line luminosity and molecular mass are shown in \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{Table} \ref{tab: LumDisProp} for both ALESS070.1 and ALESS122.1 sources. The values obtained after replacing values in the right units in equations mentioned above are summarized in \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{Table} \ref{tab: DynamMass}.\\

The errors are not shown because the values are just an estimation that will be finally known after measuring the half-light radius or the proper $\alpha_{\mathrm{CO}}$} conversion factor for each source.}

More observations in order to resolve these sources and measure the half-light radius or a more extensive analysis is needed in order to compute the right numbers corresponding to the dynamical mass. In the next section we discuss the implications of our new data on the CO SLED of ALESS122.1 and derived values for the CO luminosity ratios $\mathrm{r_{31}}$ and $\mathrm{r_{41}}$.   

\section{SLED for ALESS122.1}
\label{sec: Aless122}

As was shown in previous sections, we were able to measure the line intensity of the CO($4\rightarrow3$) transition for ALESS122.1. However, this source has been studied recently by (\textcolor{webgreen}{Huynh et al}, \citeyear{Huynh17}) and (\textcolor{webgreen}{Calistro Rivera et al}, \citeyear{Calistro17}) finding CO($1\rightarrow0$) and CO($3\rightarrow2$) transitions respectively. Therefore, we can start thinking about the CO spectral line energy distribution (SLED) for this source, though we must have in mind that more observations are needed to obtain higher 'J' transitions. In \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{Figure} \ref{fig: 122SLED}, we present the three available points (in black) for the CO SLED of ALESS122.1. Also, the moderately excited CO SLED of Arp 220 (in yellow) and GN20 (in red) which are standard SMGs to compare with and which values were taken from (\textcolor{webgreen}{Rosenberg et al}, \citeyear{rosenberg15}) and (\textcolor{webgreen}{Daddi et al}, \citeyear{Daddi09a}) respectively as shown. We can start modelling the CO SLED for our source following radiative transfer calculations and large velocity gradient models. However, as we only have three points it is quite hard to obtain a good fit which really constrains the kinetic temperature $\mathrm{T_k}$ and the molecular gas density $\rho (\mathrm{H}_2)$ due to the lack of high 'J' transitions (\textcolor{webgreen}{Strandet et al}, \citeyear{Strandet17}). This is why we decided to overplot the SLED of two well studied sources, in order to properly infer or at least have some initial prior of the behaviour for the ALES122.1 CO SLED to later perform a fit with good initial conditions  once more transitions are shown.\\

The \textit{x-axis} corresponds to the upper J transition and the \textit{y-axis} to the integrated intensity $\mathrm{I_{CO}}$ given in $\mathrm{Jy~km~s^{-1}}$. The black dots correspond to measurements performed by (\textcolor{webgreen}{Huynh et al}, \citeyear{Huynh17}) for CO($1\rightarrow0$), (\textcolor{webgreen}{Calistro Rivera et al}, \citeyear{Calistro17}) in prep. for CO($3\rightarrow2$) and our observation for CO($4\rightarrow3$). The yellow and red dots corresponds to very well known SLEDS of Arp220 (\textcolor{webgreen}{Rosenberg et al}, \citeyear{rosenberg15}) and GN20 (\textcolor{webgreen}{Carilli et al}, \citeyear{Carilli10}). The first three transition for Arp220 were measured by (\textcolor{webgreen}{Greve et al}, \citeyear{Greve09}). The transition CO($4\rightarrow3$) for GN20 was measured by (\textcolor{webgreen}{Daddi et al}, \citeyear{Daddi09a}). Both Arp220 and GN20 SLEDs were normalized to the CO(1-0) transition of ALESS122.1 to properly compare.}}
\label{fig: 122SLED}
\end{figure}

Even if we did not apply the solutions for the radiative transfer calculations to our data, we briefly describe the background to understand how our method helps us to shed a light on the behaviour of the gas reservoir. When applying a given model to find the best parameters that fit our CO SLED we basically need to set the background radiation (CMB) plus the dust radiation field. It is also necessary to provide the chemical parameters as the CO abundance relative to the molecular gas which is commonly set to $\sim8\times10^{-5}$ (\textcolor{webgreen}{Strandet et al}, \citeyear{Strandet17}) and the absorption efficiency which depends on the frequency. An estimate of collision rates (\textcolor{webgreen}{Carilli et al}, \citeyear{Carilli10}) is also needed. Once this is provided, a standard program will solve the equations creating a grid with different parameters varying the kinetic temperature and the column density in order to sample the whole parameter space. Then, it will get the best fit to the data retrieving the line intensity for a given transition and the kinetic temperature which can be translated into line integrated intensity just by multiplying by the FWHM of the line one is measuring. These values need to be interpolated to finally compare them with the actual discrete detections. \\

As we have re-normalized the CO SLED of Arp 220 and GN20 to the CO (1-0) transition of ALESS122.1 because is less biased and is a better tracer of the molecular mass, we can barely infer the physics of our gas just comparing with them as a first approximation. In (\textcolor{webgreen}{Carilli et al}, \citeyear{Carilli10}), GN20 was studied and fitted with two components, one for the lower transitions and another one for the higher transitions. The lower excitation fit led to a kinetic temperature of $\sim 30\mathrm{K}$ and molecular density of $\sim 300\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ while for the high excitation component they obtained $\sim 45\mathrm{K}$ and $\sim 6300 \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. In this case, higher excitation component is understood as transition above CO($3\rightarrow2$) which represents the compact component of the gas, while those below this limit represent the extended component i.e. the full molecular gas reservoir (\textcolor{webgreen}{Carilli et al}, \citeyear{Carilli10}). On the other hand for Arp 220, the values found in literature correspond to a kinetic temperature of $\sim180\mathrm{K}$ and a molecular density of $\sim 10^5\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. As we can observe in \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{Figure} \ref{fig: 122SLED}, our observations are pretty much below the excited CO SLED for Arp 220 and closer to the trend of GN20. Additionally, as we only have transitions up to CO($4\rightarrow3$), at the moment we could only be able to study the extended component of the molecular gas. Hence, we could say that ALESS122.1 CO SLED will have eventually if more measurements are performed, a kinetic temperature around $30\mathrm{K}$ and a molecular gas density of $\sim300\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ for the full molecular gas reservoir. However, we must take this with caution because until we fit the final CO SLED we will not be totally sure whether our estimates are the right ones or not. This method carries to the gas mass estimate, which is useful in order to compare to the values obtained through our spectral analysis in \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{Table} \ref{tab: LastValues} and finally constrain the real value of the CO-to-$\mathrm{H_2}$ conversion factor which is often set to $\alpha_\mathrm{CO} = 0.8~\mathrm{M_\odot}(\mathrm{K~km~s^{-1}~pc^2})^{-1}$ because it is consistent with the center of ULIRGs as shown by (\textcolor{webgreen}{Downes \& Solomon}, \citeyear{Downes98}).\\

\begin{equation}
 \mathrm{r_{j1,j2}} = \frac{\mathrm{I_{CO(j1,j1-1)}}}{\mathrm{I_{CO(j2,j2-1)}}}\left(\mathrm{\frac{j2}{j1}}\right)^2
 \label{eq: COratio}
\end{equation}


On the other hand using ALESS122.1 we can compute the CO luminosity ratios as we have three integrated line luminosities including our measurement. As it is presented in (\textcolor{webgreen}{Daddi et al}, \citeyear{Daddi15}) we can obtain them through \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{Equation} \ref{eq: COratio}. This is equivalent to the brightness temperature ratios between luminosities $\mathrm{j1}$ and $\mathrm{j_2}$ only in the limit of small Rayleigh-Jeans corrections. Using $\mathrm{I_{CO}}_{(3-2)} = 3.99 \pm 0.75~\mathrm{Jy~km~s^{-1}}$ reported by (\textcolor{webgreen}{Calistro Rivera et al}, \citeyear{Calistro17}) and $\mathrm{I_{CO}}_{(1-0)} = 0.64 \pm 0.07~\mathrm{Jy~km~s^{-1}}$ reported by (\textcolor{webgreen}{Huynh et al}, \citeyear{Huynh17}) we obtain $\mathrm{r_{31} = 0.69 \pm 0.02}$. Using our value for the CO($4\rightarrow3$) transition as shown in \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{Table} \ref{tab: LastValues} and the same value used above for the CO($1\rightarrow0$) we obtain $\mathrm{r_{41} = 0.32 \pm 0.01}$. Our result for $\mathrm{r_{41}}$ is in total agreement with values reported by (\textcolor{webgreen}{Daddi et al}, \citeyear{Daddi15}) and adopted in recent works as (\textcolor{webgreen}{Decarli et al}, \citeyear{Decarli16}). However, for $\mathrm{r_{31}}$ the value differs in $\sim 60\%$ with that reported in (\textcolor{webgreen}{Daddi et al}, \citeyear{Daddi15}) because the integrated line luminosity reaches its maximum in that transition for our source (see \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{Figure} \ref{fig: 122SLED}) making the CO luminosity ratio larger.\\   

In the next section, we address a final discussion about the overall work, the main results and its implications for the actual research of SMGs. We also present some future ideas that could be developed in order to check our results and finally constrain the properties for ALESS sources. 

\section{Discussion}

We have analyzed a sample of 51 ALESS targets in order to search for emission lines present in the ALMA-band 4 observations. As was shown above, we only clearly detected two CO emission which satisfied all the requirements imposed in order to guarantee real detections. It is likely that some of our possible candidates rejected were real, but until having more observations we can not really use them as they are just barely above the signal-to-noise criterion. We must have in mind that a few lines could also be present in our data but due to the observation set-up they are not too strong, also because the observations were not designed to target a given molecule transition, or sensitivity of our instruments. A way to improve our detections is a method known as `stacking'. However, we have no sufficient data to perform this, but it is something that we could have in mind for future observations.\\

Most of our results are derived from the CO($4\longrightarrow3$) transition. As was exposed above, this is not the real tracer of molecular gas mass, then we need to apply a few corrections to convert our line luminosity into an equivalent luminosity for CO($1\longrightarrow0$) which is less biased and is the real tracer of $\mathrm{m_{H_2}}$. The line intensity will be subject to the integrated line width, which in our case was chosen to be the FWHM of the given line to properly match it to the $\Delta_\mathrm{v,FWHM}$ in \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{Equation} \ref{eq: MolMass_3}.\\    

ALESS122.1 shows a really prominent transition line which is highly above the continuum and satisfies the $\Delta \chi^2$-difference without any problem. In the case of ALESS070.1, we have the transition line in between the `spw0' and `spw1' which can be seen as a gap in the emission line (see \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{Figure} \ref{fig: FitSample_1}). Although this represents a problem because we are not getting all the information for the line, the line is bright enough to be above the continuum and achieve the needed $\Delta \chi^2$-difference to be accepted. However, the detection of the line can be improved with a complete observation of the line, obtaining better values to the one-dimensional velocity dispersion that basically improves the way we obtain the molecular mass and line luminosity.\\

These transitions represent a crucial way to measure the spectroscopic redshift of the sources and constrain the parameters that describe the ongoing physics in the gas reservoirs. ALESS122.1 has been studied before by (\textcolor{webgreen}{Huynh et al}, \citeyear{Huynh17}) using CO($1\longrightarrow0$) and by (\textcolor{webgreen}{Calistro Rivera et al}, \citeyear{Calistro17}) through CO($3\longrightarrow2$). As we only have transitions up to CO($4\rightarrow3$), we see the extended emission which is consistent to the full amount of molecular gas in the galaxy, but we have no information about the compact regions which need higher 'J' transitions. Our measurements represent new extra information to compare with, at least for the molecular and dynamical masses, and a contribution to the CO SLED. This also represents a way to properly calibrate the CO-to-$\mathrm{H_2}$ conversion factor comparing different transitions which in the case of ALESS122.1 turn out to be close to values reported for ULIRGs and the standard value used by (\textcolor{webgreen}{Downes \& Solomon}, \citeyear{Downes98}). On the other hand, the detection for ALESS070.1 adds totally brand new and valuable information to study the physical conditions of the gas as to constrain the molecular mass and for future CO studies.\\

Our results were obtained for CO($4\longrightarrow3$) transition in the ALMA-band 4. The objects were not resolved, so we cannot perform any deep study about the dynamics of the gas, the rotational gradient, temperature gradient, size of the disk among others. New observations in different bands to obtain any other transition expected to the actual measured redshifts or just to simply resolve the source and perform a dynamical study of the sources is needed. Different ideas which could be addressed and explored in the future are explained in the next section. 

\section{Future Work}

In this project, we have detected two CO transitions in two ALESS sources. However, as we have not only ALESS sources in each observation but also nearby objects, we can think about performing a blind search to obtain any kind of emission lines present in each image. This can lead to multiple information of the emission lines which are useful to perform the stacking analysis. Additionally, new measurements in different bands are needed to confirm our results for ALESS070.1 and to add more valuable data to the ALESS sources. As was mentioned before, this data represents ALMA-band 4 observations obtained as part of a project by the P.I. Dr. Elisabete da Cunha. However, a new observational proposal proposed by the same P.I. to target [CII]-emission in ALMA-band 9 will shed light about the results we present here to confirm the spectroscopic redshift. Obtaining resolved data is also important in order to study the dynamics and the properties of the disks which can be combined with galactic models to deeply study this SMG population. As more observations are performed, more data points are added to the SLED for a given molecule. This implies that we can fit the SLED to the radiative transfer models in order to study the extended or compact emission in the reservoirs, the temperature and density gradients of the gas among others. Measuring the redshift through this technique needs less observation time, so we can specifically target a given emission and survey the ALESS sources using as prior the redshifts available for them to verify the redshifts measured in the zLESS project.
