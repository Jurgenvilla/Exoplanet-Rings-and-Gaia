We have presented a study of two CO observations to derive properties of sources catalogued in the ALESS-survey. Our ALMA observations were performed in the \textit{Band}-4 (C36-1 configuration) using a frequency range from $137~\mathrm{GHz}$ to $153~\mathrm{GHz}$, where every target was observed for $40$ seconds reaching a rms of $52.6$ $\mu$ Jy/beam allowing us to precisely study any emission line present in those sources. Although, the project was not dedicated to study line emission but dust continuum, we obtain free 3D data which can be use to search for line emission in our bandwidth. Because of this, if any line present we must be quite sure of its distance in order to characterize the line, otherwise it would lead to misclassification and wrong physical properties interpretation.\\

We detected a CO($4\rightarrow3$) transition in two out of 51 sources, corresponding to ALESS070.1 and ALESS122.1. In the case of ALESS122.1 multiple studies have been carried out to study CO transitions as have been reported in literature by (\textcolor{webgreen}{Huynh et al}, \citeyear{Huynh17}, \textcolor{webgreen}{Calistro Rivera et al}, \citeyear{Calistro17}) and also optic spectrum analysis in order to obtain well-measured redshifts (\textcolor{webgreen}{Danielson et al}, \citeyear{Danielson17}). The molecular mass ($\textcolor{RoyalBlue}{\mathrm{M_{H_2}} = (13.56\pm4.29)~10^{10}~\mathrm{M_\odot}\alpha_\mathrm{CO}}$) and redshift ($\textcolor{RoyalBlue}{z\sim2.0252}$) obtained for ALESS122.1 through our spectroscopic analysis is in well agreement with previous values reported by (\textcolor{webgreen}{Huynh et al}, \citeyear{Huynh17}). Our detection represents new data for the CO SLED which helps us to understand the conditions of the molecular gas (i.e. the full amount of gas because we are looking to the extended emission) environment for later study the dynamics. However, we need more measurements to properly fit the CO SLED to obtain the temperature and density of the gas. Also different observations to resolve this object is needed if one wants to study the dynamics, because in our case as was checked it is not resolved, so we cannot perform a good study of the gas.\\

On the other hand, the line detection for ALESS070.1 is in between the gap produced by two spectral windows which depends on the way the P.I performs the observation. Although, this basically affects the quality of the derived line luminosity and later the molecular mass values, the signal-to-noise ratio is high enough to trust this emission as a real one. We performed different experiments to double check which emission line it could be due to the fact that the spectroscopic redshift reported by (\textcolor{webgreen}{Danielson et al}, \citeyear{Danielson17}) does not match any plausible emission line present in this range. However, the known photometric redshift does not matches perfectly the emission, though it gives us a clue of which kind of molecule transition could be, turning out to be a CO($4\rightarrow3$) after an extensive analysis. New observations in different bands targeting possible emission lines present are needed to finally confirm this redshift and start filling the CO SLED for this source. The computed molecular mass and redshift for this source corresponds to $\textcolor{RoyalBlue}{\mathrm{M_{H_2}} = (11.74\pm4.76)~10^{10}~\mathrm{M_\odot}\alpha_\mathrm{CO}}$ and $\textcolor{RoyalBlue}{z\sim2.3197}$.\\

The conversion factor $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$ was left as a free parameter because at the moment different values are reported in the literature spanning in a wide range. However, we can star thinking about the possible values for ALESS122.1 because as we have three different transitions measured for CO, we could compute this value in order to obtain the final values for molecular and dynamical mass. In both cases we computed the dynamical mass, however, it was left in terms of the CO-to-$\mathrm{H_2}$ conversion factor or the half light radius. Future observations are needed to obtain the size of the sources in order to properly study the dynamics of the gas because with our current observations the sources resulted be not resolved after deconvolving the beam. The values obtained for ALESS122.1 after comparing our emission CO($4\rightarrow3$) and (\textcolor{webgreen}{Calistro Rivera et al}, \citeyear{Calistro17}) CO($3\rightarrow2$) to (\textcolor{webgreen}{Huynh et al}, \citeyear{Huynh17}) CO($1\rightarrow0$) seem to be in average $\alpha_\mathrm{CO} \sim (1.1 \pm 5.6)~\mathrm{M_\odot}(\mathrm{K~km~s^{-1}~pc^2})^{-1}$\\

In the future, targeting a given molecule transition for ALESS sources could be addressed using as priors the redshifts provided by the zLESS project (\textcolor{webgreen}{Danielson et al}, \citeyear{Danielson17}). Also, analysing our current data in search for any emission line present not only in the ALESS source but in any source in the field could be really interesting.
