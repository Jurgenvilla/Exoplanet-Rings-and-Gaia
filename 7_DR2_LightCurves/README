1) Open the Gaia_AstroQuery.ipynb to get the new Data.
   Files will be stored in the LCC_Test.csv, UCL_Test.csv and US_Test.csv files
   Each one has columns: 
   source_id,ra,ra_error,dec,dec_error,parallax,parallax_error,l,b,g_mag_abs,g_min_ks,pmra,pmra_error,pmdec,pmdec_error
   
2) This files are already cut-off using Mamajeck proper motions and parallax conditions.
   If needed, one can also use the 5Myr isochrone with Av[extintion] per field and the 60Myr isochrone without extintion 
   to select the final sample. 
   
3) One way or another RA and DEC must be saved to get the light curves from the SuperWASP database. 
   RA and DEC are saved automatically from the Gaia query in:
   LCC_Coordinates.csv, UCL_Coordinates.csv and US_Coordinates.csv
   
   Move all the tables and fits to LCC, UCL and US
   
4) Folders LCC, UCL and US contain the tables and fit files to plot the light curves. 
   Also the scripts from the SuperWASP database to retreive the data.
   
5) Using the scripts: 
   Light_Curves_LCC.ipynb, Light_Curves_UCL.ipynb and Light_Curves_US.ipynb
   the final sample of light curves is obtained and stored in two different folders.
